## How to use

In the folder /src/webhooks/telegram there is a piece of the project cut out of context, written by me and responsible for sending notifications under certain conditions to the Telegram bot.

In the /src/extension folder there is an example module in the current simple architecture without tests.

## Warning
This project cannot be run because it is part of another project and there is no coherence, some code fragments have been removed due to confidentiality
